# Satellite Imagery Analysis

**Land_Cover_Classification_in_Satellite_Imagery_using_Python.ipynb:**

This notebook contains Python code and explanations for performing land cover classification on satellite images. Land cover classification involves categorizing the pixels of an image into classes like vegetation, water bodies, urban areas, etc.

**Ground_Truth_Labeling_of_Satellite_Imagery_using_K_Means_Clustering_with_Python.ipynb:**

This notebook deals with the creation of ground truth labels for satellite images using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Ground truth labeling is essential for supervised learning tasks, and K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering.

**Flood_Detection_and_Monitoring_using_Satellite_Imagery_with_Python.ipynb:**

This notebook has detail methods for detecting and monitoring floods using satellite imagery. This analyzing changes in water bodies over time and identifying inundated areas.


**Satellite_Imagery_Analysis_101_Handling_TIFF_Files.ipynb:**

This notebook provides a beginner's guide to satellite imagery analysis, with a focus on handling TIFF files, which are a common format for high-quality satellite images.

**Sundarbans_Satellite_Imagery_Analysis_using_Python.ipynb:**

This notebook is dedicated to analyzing satellite imagery of the Sundarbans, a significant mangrove area. It might include specific analyses pertinent to this geographic region.

**Unsupervised_Learning_in_Satellite_Imagery_using_Python.ipynb:**

This notebook likely covers the application of unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering, anomaly detection, or dimensionality reduction, to satellite imagery data.


**Dimensionality_Reduction_Techniques_for_satellite_Imagery.ipynb:**

This notebook explains and implements dimensionality reduction techniques, which are crucial for reducing the number of random variables under consideration and can be integral for compressing data, speeding up computations, and improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.
